7. Write a program that shows the binary equivalent of a given positive number between 
0 to 255

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int n,r,binary=0,i=1;
	printf("num");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	while(n!=0)
	{
		r = n%2;
		n =n/2;
		binary = binary+i*r;
		i =i*10; 
	}
	printf("%d",binary);
	return 0;
}
