 8.A building has 10 floors with a floor height of 3 meters each. A ball  is
dropped from the top of the building. Find the time taken by the ball to
reach each floor. (Use the formula s = ut+(1/2)at^2 where u and a are the
initial velocity in m/sec (= 0) and acceleration in m/sec^2 (A= 9.8 m/s^)
